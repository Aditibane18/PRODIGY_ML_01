# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project, developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, involves building a linear regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates, offering valuable insights for real estate professionals, potential buyers, and sellers.

## Project Details

The project leverages the 1990 California census data, containing 20,640 observations with 8 features. These features are used to predict house prices through a carefully constructed linear regression model.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Delivers reliable house price estimates.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides insights based on historical data.
- **Practical Application**: Beneficial for real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook

## Goals
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust linear regression model capable of predicting house prices accurately using historical data. This will assist:

- Real estate professionals in assessing market trends.
- Potential buyers in making informed purchasing decisions.
- Sellers in pricing their properties competitively.
